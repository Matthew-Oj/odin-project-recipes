# Odin Recipes
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum — a hands-on exercise to practice HTML fundamentals.  

The goal is to build a basic recipe website where each recipe has its own page and users can navigate between recipes. This iteration focuses on **structure and organization** of HTML: headings, lists, images, links, and page hierarchy. CSS styling will be added in future iterations.
